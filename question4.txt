Write a short note on Tag and element with an example? 
=> In HTML, a tag is used to define different elements within a webpage. 
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets <>, and they indicate the beginning and end of an element. 
An element consists of the opening tag, content, and closing tag. 

Example:- 
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p> 
<p> is the opening tag for a paragraph element. 
"This is a paragraph of text." is the content of the paragraph. 
</p> is the closing tag for the paragraph element. 
Together, the opening tag, content, and closing tag form the <p> element, 
which represents a paragraph of text on the webpage.
